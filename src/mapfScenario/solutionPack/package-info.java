/**
 * Solution Pack was created for purpose of performing multiple solver initializations, and displaying multiple solutions
 * at one time. Also it generates modified file with ozobot instruction, that allows on one load code to ozobot and perform
 * on that load multiple solution play. That was possible by overloading agnetID and rather make it PathID.
 * So when such solution is tested, it is blinked not robot id, but path id.
